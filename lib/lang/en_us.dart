## How to play
ConnectTic is a mashup of Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4. The goal of the game is to get 4 pieces
connected in a row, column, or diagonal (similar to Connect 4). To accomplish this, you can play on
any empty tile on the board (similar to Tic-Tac-Toe). There is a catch, you cannot play on any tile
directly next to your last played piece. This twist makes the game much more challanging and
introduced new stratagies into the mix. Have fun!!!

## About ConnectTic
ConnectTic is a combination of the classics Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4. The game was first played as
a joke/crazy version of Connect 4 with the question "What if we could play anywhere" (instead of
having the pieces fall from gravity). The concept was then developed and balanced into a playable
form, ConnectTic.
